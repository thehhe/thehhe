### Hello! 👋

My name is Maciek and I am a data scientist. I currently am working for AltaML as an Associate Machine Learning Developer and I am looking for new ✨opportunities✨ after my graduation. I have a number of years as a software and data developer.

This is my repository of previous projects, mostly from school.

I would like to share some of the projects that my dream-team completed during our Master of Data Science and Analytics at the University of Calgary (shout-out to [Ewa](https://github.com/EwaRambally) and [Zoe](https://github.com/Zulihumaer), my awesome collaborators! 💃):

- 💡 **[Emergency Shelters Analysis in Calgary, AB](https://github.com/thehhe/DATA_601_project)**
  - 🌸 based on the datasets provided by the City of Calgary and Alberta government,
  - 🌸 considered a number of different factors that might influence the occupancy rate of the emergency shelters, such as weather data (temperature and precipitation) and economic data (unemployment rate and change in weekly wages),
  - 🌸 analyzed after how long the aforementioned factors might affect the Emrgency Shelters admission the most,
  - 🌸 the outcome was a Jupyter notebook containing interactive visualizations and the conclusions of what the data was saying,
  - 🌸 tech stack:
    - Python,
    - pandas - for data cleaning and wrangling,
    - BeautifulSoup - for scraping emergency shelter addresses from the government websites
    - matplotlib - for static graphs
    - plotly - for an interactive map that displays the shelters occupancy and crime count in the neighbourhoods in the city

- 💡 **Traffic Comparison Between Chicago and Toronto**
  - 🌸 based on publicly available data sources provided by the City of Toronto and the City of Chicago,
  - 🌸 conducted a relational database based analysis on factors of traffic collisions in two cities,
  - 🌸 the focus of the project was to compare the change of distribution in traffic collision causes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as after the restrictions were lifted,
  - 🌸 tech stack:
    - MariaDB - for hosting the data,
    - Python,
    - pandas - for reading from the database and performing data cleaning
    - matplotlib - for visualizations

- 💡 **[Visual Analysis of “The Office”](https://medium.com/@pecakmaciek/visual-analysis-of-the-office-u-of-c-2023-data-605-project-b0a621c0034f)** individually
  - 🌸 a data driven article exploring NLP and visualization techniques based on the transcriptions from the popular show ”The Office”
  - 🌸 the article tries to answer several ques- tions with smart visualizations, such as:
    - how did screen time (measured by the number of lines spoken in the episode) influence the audience perception of the episode (based on IMDb ratings),
    - analysis of the most positive and negative characters based on what they said, in opinion of the audiences

- 💡 **Cryptocurrencies Live Dashboard**
  - 🌸 prepared a live dashboard that summarized the time- series prices and transaction volumes for selected cryptocurrencies
  - 🌸 tech stack:
    - kafka - for streaming real time cryptocurrency transactions,
    - GCP - as this was a cloud based project, we decided to host our application there,
    - docker - for modularizing the services,
    - BigQuery - for storing the intermediate results,
    - Tableau - for visualizing the dashboard,
    - Python

My personal projects / things I'm learning about that are started and I am slowly working towards completing them when I have some time to spare:

- 🌼 Stanford's CS224n course: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning
- 🌼 Haskell Programming
- 🌼 Azure DP-100 exam
- 🌼 MIT's Topics In Mathematics With Applications In Finance course
